Data Structures: The project requires the implementation of data structures like arrays or lists to store and organize financial data efficiently.

User Input and Validation: Proper handling of user input is crucial to ensure accurate data entry. Input validation techniques will be utilized to prevent incorrect or invalid data from being processed.

File Handling: The Budget Planner will involve reading and writing data to files, allowing users to save their budget and financial information for future reference.

Implementation Steps

Step 1: Data Storage and Management: Implement mechanisms to store and manage the userâ€™s financial data, such as creating data structures to store expenses, budgets, and goals. Utilize file-handling techniques to enable data persistence.
Step 2: Expense Tracking: Develop functionality to allow users to input their expenses and categorize them appropriately. The system should calculate total expenses and provide visual representations of spending patterns.
Step 3: Budget Creation and Monitoring: Implement features that enable users to set budget limits for different expense categories and track their spending against these budgets. Notify users when they exceed their set limits.
Step 4: Goal Setting and Progress Tracking: Provide functionality for users to set financial goals and track their progress. Display visual representations of goal achievement to motivate users and encourage good financial habits.
